Write a Django UI to manage BIND DNS Zones.

Models:
* tsig keys
  * name
  * key text
  Methods:
    * add key
    * delete key
* dns server
  * alias
  * hostname
  Methods:
    * list records
    * delete record
    * add record
    * lookup record

Forms:
* print zone
* edit zone
  * do we just let user add/delete a record
* perform lookup?

Todo:
* Be able to input tsig key into form and save in db. Then associate bind server with key. (Down to zone level?)
